The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. 
This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;


How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;


The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:

Example
DELETE FROM Customers;
