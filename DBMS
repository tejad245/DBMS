The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. 
This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
